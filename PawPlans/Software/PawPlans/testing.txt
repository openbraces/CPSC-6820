Currently we have two testing modules, menu_test.cpp and scheduling_test.cpp

menu_test.cpp
	test_header -> Tests the basic render of the render_string

	test_select_wifi -> Tests selecting the wifi menu from root screen
	test_select_clock -> Tests selecting the clock menu from root screen
	test_select_schedule -> Tests selecting the schedule menu from root screen

	test_clock_select_minutes -> Tests selecting the minutes in setting the clock

	test_clock_increment_hour -> Tests incrementing the hour in setting the clock
	test_clock_decrement_hour -> Tests decrementing the hour in setting the clock
	test_clock_increment_minutes -> Tests incrementing the minutes in setting the clock
	test_clock_decrement_minutes -> Tests decrementing the minutes in setting the clock

scheduling_test.cpp
	test_add_schedule_entry -> Tests adding a schedule entry
	test_remove_schedule_entry -> Tests removing a schedule entry

For testing the modules we used platformio, they have a built in testing suite that
can easily be run with the command:
C:\path\to\.platformio\penv\Scripts\platformio.exe test --environment m5stack-stamps3

The requirement for testing is that you need the esp-32 in order to upload the test which
is required for testing.
